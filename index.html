<h1>DESTINY OF FIRE</h1>
	<p>
		In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst
                into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful
                for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. Life ia a flame that is always 
                burning itself out, but it catches fire again every time a child is born. If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror,
                because I bet that's what really throws you into panic.

<h1>THE NIGHT SKY</h1>
	<p>
		When it is dark enough, you can see the stars. No sight is more provocative of awe 
                than is the night sky. There was always something new to be seen in the unchanging
                night sky.If the night sky was in human form, then i think that many people would 
                not look. It's because of what it is, that makes us all wish that we were stars or astronauts. The night sky is a dignified black princess 
                freckled with the stars. Get lost in her beauty to find it.

<h1>A BULB</h1>
	<p>
		A Bible not read is like a bulb not lighted. Only insane people will love
                to work in the darkness with Kings' bulbs which are not switched on. And 
                so goes the one who has the King James' but does not search into it.
		Too often the spotlight that highlights our successes burns out quickly, while the spotlight that scrutinizes our failures is a long-life bulb.
		When all seems lost keep the faith walk on, there's a bulb at the end .
